# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository follows the [Engineering Constitution](../docs/engineering-constitution.md).

All generated or modified code must comply with:
docs/engineering-constitution.md

Pay particular attention to:
- Validation at trust boundaries
- Known-safe failure states
- No hidden side effects
- Human-readable errors and logs
- Explicit configuration and dependencies

If a request conflicts with the constitution, the constitution wins.
